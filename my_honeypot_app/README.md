Honey Pot App

This is a simple Flask application designed as a learning project to explore Python development, web security concepts, and iterative improvement. The application includes a login system, a honeypot area, and plans for future database integration.

Features

	•	Home Page: A welcome page introducing the Honey Pot App.
	•	Login System: Users can log in with pre-defined credentials.
	•	Honeypot Page: A restricted area designed to simulate a honeypot and log unauthorized access attempts.
	•	Logout Functionality: Users can securely log out of their session.

Setup Instructions

	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd honey-pot-app


	2.	Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then install required packages:

pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-bcrypt


	3.	Run the Application:
Start the Flask server on port 8080:

python app.py

By default, Flask runs on http://127.0.0.1:8080.

	4.	Access the Application:
Open a web browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8080

Learning Goals

	•	SQLAlchemy Integration: Future iterations will replace the in-memory user dictionary with an SQLite database for persistent user management.
	•	Password Hashing: Passwords will be securely stored using bcrypt hashing.
	•	Honeypot Logging: Unauthorized access attempts will be logged in a database for analysis.
	•	User Roles: Plan to introduce user roles (e.g., admin, user) for enhanced access control.
